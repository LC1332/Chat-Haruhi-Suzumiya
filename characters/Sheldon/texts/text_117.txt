Penny:「Do you have any idea what time it is?」
Sheldon:「Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.」

Penny:「Well imagine how I'm feeling.」
Sheldon:「Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit.」

Howard:「Worked for my parents.」
Penny:「''(Knocking and entering)'' Hi guys.」
Leonard:「Oh, hey.」
Penny:「I need some guinea pigs.」
Sheldon:「Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.」
Penny:「I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of talking to you.」
Leonard:「His mom's been saying that for years. What's up?」
Penny:「Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks.」
Leonard:「Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.」
Sheldon:「With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example.」

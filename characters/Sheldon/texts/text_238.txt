'''Scene''':「''[[Raj's apartment]].''」
Sheldon:「This is a very old building.」
Raj:「Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.」
Sheldon:「Uh-oh.」
Raj:「What?」
Sheldon:「Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?」
Raj:「Not until now.」
Sheldon:「I can't believe I didn't bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it.」
Raj:「Well, if you're not comfortable staying here, Sheldon...」
Sheldon:「I'm kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.」
Raj:「Terrific.」
Sheldon:「''(Referring to Bollywood singing on television)'' Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?」
Raj:「Yes, isn't she an amazing actress.」
Sheldon:「Actually, I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.」
Raj:「How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.」
Sheldon:「Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Obviously you're not that familiar with Indian cinema.」

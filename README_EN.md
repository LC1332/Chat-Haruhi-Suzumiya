Chat-Haruhi-Suzumiya is one of the subproject of [Luotuo](https://github.com/LC1332/Luotuo-Chinese-LLM), which was initiated by Cheng Li, Ziang Leng, and Qiyuan Chen.
 
This project is a work [in progress](#todo-and-feature). With the release of the Arxiv version, we will publish a dataset supporting 32 characters and 52K dialogues, along with the corresponding local model and ChatHaruhi1.0 inference code, within a week. We will then begin refactoring the project for [ChatHaruhi2.0](#chatharuhi_20_design).
 
This project is licensed under Apache 2.0, which permits commercial use. However, you still need to comply with other relevant agreements, including:

- The copyright of the character roles themselves.
  
- The terms of any APIs used in the project, such as OpenAI's agreement.
  
- The licenses of any models used in the project (for example, if we later adopt models from LlaMA or GLM, etc).

## Quick Start

To get started with the ChatHaruhi1.0 project, you can directly run the following Colab notebooks:

| Name |Colab Link| Description         |
|---|---|---|
| ChatHaruhi1.0                                                |<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/LC1332/Chat-Haruhi-Suzumiya/blob/main/notebook/reform_main.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>| Fully-featured client that allows switching between different character roles. |
| ChatHaruhi2.0(EA) | <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/LC1332/Haruhi-2-Dev/blob/main/notebook/test_LangChainOpenAILLM.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/> | ChatHaruhi2.0 with OpenAI LLMs|

We are refactoring the code for ChatHaruhi 2.0, which will be solve the high module coupling problem of version 1.0 - it will be released as a pip-installable library with improved modularity.

## ChatHaruhi_2.0_Design

ChatHaruhi started as an open source project with multimodal features like images and voice added to participate in competitions. Developers can now try the Gradio demo in the source code. However, this design isn't ideal for future research goals like adding characters, studying interactions, enhancing memory, or connecting to a Unity game backend.  
  
After this arxiv release, we will rebuild ChatHaruhi with the following planned interfaces:

```python
from ChatHaruhi import ChatHaruhi

chatbot = ChatHaruhi( system_prompt = 'prompt.txt', \
                      story_db = 'story_chroma_folder', \
                      llm = 'openai' )
                      
response = chatbot.chat(text = 'Can you introduce youself?', role = 'Kyon' )
```

The system will use a simple system_prompt parameter and vector database for access. It will support switching between LLMs like the locally trained model from this paper, Claude, Spark API, etc. For conversations using the ChatHaruhi-52K characters, you can use them directly out of the box below.
```python
from ChatHaruhi import ChatHaruhi

chatbot = ChatHaruhi( role_name = 'Haruhi', \
                      llm = 'openai' )
                      
response = chatbot.chat(text = 'Can you introduce youself?', role = 'Kyon' )
```

## SponsorShip

Due to Chat Haruhi Suzumiya adopts a strategy similar to CoT, which is 10-20 times more expensive than usual. Currently, API tokens are supported by community donations.

In addition, we are actively looking for GPUs (A100, A800). If you are willing to donate, please contact us. We greatly appreciate any support to help keep Chat Haruhi Suzumiya running.

If you are interested in sponsoring the [Luotuo Project](https://github.com/LC1332/Luotuo-Chinese-LLM#%E8%B5%9E%E5%8A%A9sponsorships), please click on the [major project](https://github.com/LC1332/Luotuo-Chinese-LLM) or view the [sponsorship form](https://github.com/LC1332/Luotuo-Chinese-LLM/blob/main/data/Sponsorship_and_balance.md).
